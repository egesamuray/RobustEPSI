   scons: done building targets.</pre><p>While the output looks complicated, what has really happened is that three MATLAB scripts have been generated, each one will
            execute the Robust EPSI program with slightly different parameters. (<i>This script was only tested in the BASH shell; if you use a different shell and it doesn't work,</i> <a href="mailto:tlin@eos.ubc.ca">e-mail me</a>) To understand what is going on, let's look into the <tt>SConstruct</tt> file. The interesting part starts at line 49:
         </p><pre>   # define a common set of options
   commonopt={}
   commonopt["matlab_func"] = default_matfcts
   commonopt["input_file"] = "../data/model1_150_by_150_shot_106_255.mat"
   commonopt["maxTotalIter"] = 70
   commonopt["padtime"] = 11
   commonopt["topmuteT"] = 0.15
   commonopt["q_estLength_posT"] = 0.1
   commonopt["q_estLength_negT"] = 0.1
   commonopt["useOblique"] = 1
   commonopt["relError"] = 0.05
   commonopt["window_startT"] = 0.15
   commonopt["window_endT"] = 1
   commonopt["savepreviewmat"] = 1
   commonopt["show_preview"] = 1
   commonopt["verbosity"] = 0</pre><p>This section defines default settings for each program. For the SINBAD software release, Robust EPSI is organized such that
            each of the folders <tt>Synthetic</tt>, <tt>GulfOfSuez178</tt>, and <tt>GulfOfSuez355</tt> correspond to a specific dataset (see <tt>README_examples.txt</tt> for more information), and therefore the settings above are specific to one dataset.
         </p>
         <p>It may look like there is a lot of settings, but only a few of these are truly important: <b>input_file</b>, <b>topmuteT</b>, <b>maxTotalIter</b>, and <b>relError</b>. The rest are typical default values that is simply included here for the sake of  explicitness. See the included <tt>PARAMETERS_LIST.txt</tt> file for more detials regarding these parameters.
         </p>
         <p>The next three blocks in the <tt>SConstruct</tt> file corresponds to the three MATLAB scripts that were outputted when we ran <tt>SCons</tt>. Each block does the same thing:
         </p>
         <div>
            <ul>
               <li>clone the default settings in <tt>commonopt</tt> (technically by cloning the Python dict obtect)
               </li>
               <li>give this new "experiment" a different name (this will end up determining the name of the resulting MATLAB script)</li>
               <li>add some additional parameter settings</li>
               <li>append this particular "experiment" to the list that keeps track of all experiments to generate custom MATLAB scripts for.</li>
            </ul>
         </div><pre>   # Serial version without using sparsity frames
   expr=commonopt.copy()
   expr["name"] = "Synthetic"
   expr["useSparsity"] = 0
   expr["parallel"] = 0
   expr["output_primary_file"] = expr["name"] + "_primary.mat"
   expr["output_primaryIR_file"] = expr["name"] + "_primaryIR.mat"
   expr["output_wavelet_file"] = expr["name"] + "_wavelet.mat"
   runs.append(expr)</pre><p>It is perhaps best to think of this script as a preference file. The above block will generate the file <tt>Synthetic.m</tt> in the <tt>Synthetic</tt> directory. If you look into this script, you will see that it simply calls the main Robust EPSI driver <tt>EPSI_SLIM_main.m</tt> with the specified parameters passed in as keyword-argument pairs.
         </p>
         <p>You are of course free to set your own parameters. Any parameter in <tt>PARAMETERS_LIST.txt</tt> can be specified by copying the convention here. If you don't want to override existing settings, simply copy and insert
            the above block below all the others and give it a new name.
         </p>
         <p>For more information on the different settings I have provided here, and also how you can use your own dataset, please see
            the included <tt>README_examples.txt</tt> file.
         </p>
         <h2>Step 3: Execute the Robust EPSI program<a name="12"></a></h2>
         <p>With all the parameters already set, executing the program is very easy. Simply enter MATLAB and execute any one of the scripts.
            <tt>Synthetic.m</tt> is a short example of Robust EPSI executed on a small synthetic dataset for 70 iterations, and should take no more than half-an-hour
            on a machine with &gt;4GB memory.

%% Walkthrough for robust estimation of primaries by sparse inversion via one-norm minimization
% A guide to getting up and running with Robust EPSI on an example synthetic dataset 
%
% Tim Tai-Yi Lin (tlin@eos.ubc.ca),  March 19th 2012

%% Prerequisites
% * This guide assumes that you are using a unix-style terminal.
%% 
% * This walkthrough requires <http://www.scons.org/ SCons>, which is a modern
% version of |Make|. You should already have <http://www.scons.org/ SCons>

%%
% * This walkthrough also implicitly assumes that you can execute the
% <http://curl.haxx.se/ cURL> utility from the command line, which is almost
% always the case. Try executing |curl| in your terminal to see if it exists.
%%
% * Finally, the Robust EPSI program itself is written in pure MATLAB, and
% requires MATLAB r2009B (7.9) or newer versions.

%% Step 1: Obtain example dataset

% While the output looks complicated, what has really happened is that three MATLAB scripts have been generated, each one will execute the Robust EPSI program with slightly different parameters. (_This script was only tested in the BASH shell; if you use a different shell and it doesn't work,_ <mailto:tlin@eos.ubc.ca e-mail me>) To understand what is going on, let's look into the |SConstruct| file. The interesting part starts at line 49:
%
%     # define a common set of options
%     commonopt={}
%     commonopt["matlab_func"] = default_matfcts 
%     commonopt["input_file"] = "../data/model1_150_by_150_shot_106_255.mat"
%     commonopt["maxTotalIter"] = 70
%     commonopt["padtime"] = 11
%     commonopt["topmuteT"] = 0.15
%     commonopt["q_estLength_posT"] = 0.1
%     commonopt["q_estLength_negT"] = 0.1
%     commonopt["useOblique"] = 1
%     commonopt["relError"] = 0.05
%     commonopt["window_startT"] = 0.15
%     commonopt["window_endT"] = 1
%     commonopt["savepreviewmat"] = 1
%     commonopt["show_preview"] = 1
%     commonopt["verbosity"] = 0
%
% This section defines default settings for each program. For the SINBAD software release, Robust EPSI is organized such that each of the folders |Synthetic|, |GulfOfSuez178|, and |GulfOfSuez355| correspond to a specific dataset (see |README_examples.txt| for more information), and therefore the settings above are specific to one dataset.
%%
% It may look like there is a lot of settings, but only a few of these are truly important: *input_file*, *topmuteT*, *maxTotalIter*, and *relError*. The rest are typical default values that is simply included here for the sake of  explicitness. See the included |PARAMETERS_LIST.txt| file for more detials regarding these parameters.
%%
% The next three blocks in the |SConstruct| file corresponds to the three MATLAB scripts that were outputted when we ran |SCons|. Each block does the same thing:
% 
% * clone the default settings in |commonopt| (technically by cloning the Python dict obtect)
% * give this new "experiment" a different name (this will end up determining the name of the resulting MATLAB script)
% * add some additional parameter settings
% * append this particular "experiment" to the list that keeps track of all experiments to generate custom MATLAB scripts for.
%     
%     # Serial version without using sparsity frames
%     expr=commonopt.copy()
%     expr["name"] = "Synthetic"
%     expr["useSparsity"] = 0
%     expr["parallel"] = 0
%     expr["output_primary_file"] = expr["name"] + "_primary.mat"
%     expr["output_primaryIR_file"] = expr["name"] + "_primaryIR.mat"
%     expr["output_wavelet_file"] = expr["name"] + "_wavelet.mat"
%     runs.append(expr)
%
% It is perhaps best to think of this script as a preference file. The above block will generate the file |Synthetic.m| in the |Synthetic| directory. If you look into this script, you will see that it simply calls the main Robust EPSI driver |EPSI_SLIM_main.m| with the specified parameters passed in as keyword-argument pairs.
%%
% You are of course free to set your own parameters. Any parameter in |PARAMETERS_LIST.txt| can be specified by copying the convention here. If you don't want to override existing settings, simply copy and insert the above block below all the others and give it a new name.
%%
% For more information on the different settings I have provided here, and also how you can use your own dataset, please see the included |README_examples.txt| file.

%% Step 3: Execute the Robust EPSI program
% With all the parameters already set, executing the program is very easy. Simply enter MATLAB and execute any one of the scripts. |Synthetic.m| is a short example of Robust EPSI executed on a small synthetic dataset for 70 iterations, and should take no more than half-an-hour on a machine with >4GB memory.

% You can set |verbosity = 1| to enable more detailed output of the optimization algorithms used to solve for the surface-free impulse response and the source wavelet.

%% Step 4: Viewing the result
% The script we just executed above is set to save the resulting output to the files |Synthetic_primary.mat|, |Synthetic_primaryIR.mat|, and  |Synthetic_wavelet.corrected.mat|. You can view them by opening the files in MATLAB. You can also have Robust EPSI output SU file or native single-precision binary blobs by setting the extension to ".su" and ".bin" respectively.
%%
% We also have a built-in utility (|/tools/algorithms/REPSI/display_Preview.m|) for viewing a small preview of the result (generated in the |Preview| subdirectory when the parameter |savepreviewmat = 1|). In |Synthetic.m| setting it is set to execute automatically, but you can run it in a standalone fashion: 

display_Preview('../Synthetic/Preview/Synthetic_preview.mat')

%%
% This concludes the tutorial on executing Robust EPSI using the built-in dataset. Please feel free to play with different settings or use your own dataset. See |README_examples.txt| for more information.
